🎯 Number Guesser with GUI

A Java-based number guessing game with both console and graphical user interface (GUI) components. The user selects the guessing range and number of attempts, making each playthrough customizable and engaging.

🚀 Features
📌Built using Java
📌Console and GUI-based interface
📌User-defined guessing range
📌Limited attempts for guessing the number
📌Simple and organized structure using classes and functions

🧠 How It Works
User Inputs:
1. Let the user click the START button to start the game
2. The user is asked to enter the number of tries allowed.
3. Then, the minimum and maximum range for the random number is set.
4. A random number is generated based on the range.
5. The user tries to guess the number:
6. Feedback is given whether the guess is too high or too low.
7. The game ends either when:
7.1 The correct number is guessed, or
7.2 All attempts are used up (in which case, the correct number is revealed).
8. Prompts the user to click START button to restart the game again

🛠️ How to Run
To play the game, compile and run the Java file using any Java IDE or compiler that supports GUI applications. Make sure all required files are in the same directory.
